# Founding Agent Failure Review

## One failure. Five business days. An evidence-backed decision.

Tracify will investigate one consequential failure in one customer-facing AI agent workflow using sanitized staging evidence.

| Term | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| Fee | **$1,000 USD, paid upfront** |
| Availability | First three founding customers |
| Delivery | Five business days from accepted evidence |
| Workflow | One agent workflow |
| Failure | One agreed failure scenario |
| Evidence | 10–25 sanitized staging traces or one staging reproduction |
| Customer contact | One technical owner for questions and the readout |

## Deliverables

Tracify will provide:

1. One annotated representative trace.
2. One evidence-backed failure mechanism.
3. One tested fix or an explicit stop/rollback recommendation.
4. Five regression cases.
5. One concise investigation report.
6. One 45-minute technical readout.

The review succeeds when one finding changes code, prompt, retrieval, tool handling, data, or release policy.

## Customer inputs

The customer supplies:

- A concise description of what the agent did incorrectly and the consequence.
- One agent workflow and one technical owner.
- 10–25 sanitized staging traces or access to a staging reproduction.
- The expected behavior and any known healthy comparison.
- Timely answers to narrow technical questions during the review.

## Evidence boundary

This founding review accepts sanitized staging evidence only. Do not provide:

- Production personally identifiable information or unredacted customer conversations.
- Secrets, credentials, payment data, health data, or regulated data.
- Model-provider API keys.
- Arbitrary repositories or executable customer code.

Tracify records the files received, agreed retention period, and deletion date. Supplied evidence is deleted after the report and agreed review window.

If prohibited data is discovered, Tracify will stop handling it, request a sanitized replacement, and adjust the delivery date if needed.

## Out of scope

The review does not include:

- General implementation or staff augmentation.
- Multiple agents, workflows, or failure scenarios.
- Production monitoring setup or alert configuration.
- An ongoing evaluation program.
- Repository review or execution of customer code.
- Access to production systems or regulated data.

Additional needs can be scoped separately only after this review is complete.

## Refund condition

If Tracify cannot produce at least one evidence-backed finding from the evidence agreed before payment, Tracify will refund the $1,000 fee. The refund condition does not guarantee that Tracify can implement a fix, recover missing evidence, or reproduce behavior outside the agreed staging boundary.

## Acceptance

Before payment, both parties confirm in writing:

- The workflow and failure scenario.
- The accepted evidence and data boundary.
- The delivery start date and delivery date.
- The finding that would count as a changed engineering or release decision.
- The review-window end date and data-deletion date.

Payment confirms acceptance of this scope.
