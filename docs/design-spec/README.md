## Corrections vs. Original Brief

1. **Free tier:** 50,000 spans/month (not 1,000/day as in original draft)
2. **Hero code sample:** Uses actual `fivetoone` API: `trace_agent`, `llm_call`, `tool_call`
3. **Tagline:** "Five signals. One truth." (not "every step your agent takes" as tagline)
4. **Integrations:** Autogen, CrewAI, Haystack, DSPy, Semantic Kernel added to framework grid
5. **Auth:** Clerk `colorInputBackground: "#1C1C1C"` (Surface 3, not Surface 2)
6. **Onboarding:** Step 2 includes "Download .env" option; Step 3 has explicit "Skip for now" link
7. **Onboarding Step 4:** 60-second timeout with troubleshooting accordion (not just "troubleshoot" link)
8. **Sidebar nav order:** Overview / Runs / Costs / Alerts — then — API Keys / Team / Settings
9. **Sidebar bottom:** Docs link + Clerk UserButton + notification bell (not just user avatar)
10. **Dashboard stat cards:** Total spend today / Spans today / Active runs / Failed runs today
