# Design QA — mobile navigation switchboard

- Source visual truth: `C:\Users\krist\.codex\generated_images\019fffc5-99e0-7212-b878-0d992aac8496\exec-05719ccc-74fd-486f-948b-f7c6fd338dcd.png`
- Implementation screenshot: `C:\Tracify\scratch\design-audit-2026-08-14\04-mobile-navigation-option2-implementation.png`
- Requested viewport: 390 × 844 CSS px
- Captured implementation pixels: 375 × 754 at browser density 1
- Source pixels: 853 × 1844; the generated concept is a tall scrolling composition rather than a literal 390 × 844 capture
- State: public mobile navigation open with Product expanded

## Full-view comparison evidence

The source and implementation were inspected together in one comparison input. The implementation preserves the source hierarchy: compact brand header, switchboard label, yellow expanded section, oversized numbered category control, 2 × 2 destination grid, dedicated Pricing tile, collapsed numbered sections, and black account action. The implementation intentionally uses a real viewport-height scroll container because the source composition is more than twice a phone viewport tall.

## Focused-region comparison evidence

The header, Product control, tile grid, and Pricing row are readable in the full-view comparison. A separate crop was not needed. Typography remains the existing Tracify pixel/mono system; borders, zero-radius geometry, paper/black/yellow tokens, and icon weight match the selected direction closely.

## Required fidelity surfaces

- Fonts and typography: existing Geist Pixel Square and Geist Mono hierarchy retained; navigation labels are materially larger than the previous 9px links and supporting copy is 14px.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: 16px mobile inset, 96px section controls, 160px destination tiles, and consistent one-pixel rules reproduce the switchboard rhythm without clipping tap targets.
- Colors and visual tokens: `#eceae3`, black, and `#f4d44d` map directly to the source; no gradients, radii, or soft elevation were introduced.
- Image and icon fidelity: the source contains no raster imagery. Existing Lucide line icons are used consistently with the product's installed icon system rather than custom-drawn assets.
- Copy and content: all existing destinations are preserved with their current product descriptions; Pricing and the authenticated/unauthenticated account actions remain reachable.

## Interaction and browser evidence

- Product is expanded by default.
- Selecting Company hides Product destinations and reveals Company destinations.
- All category controls expose `aria-expanded` and a matching controlled region.
- Browser console on `/contact` reported no errors during the clean interaction pass.

## Findings

No actionable P0, P1, or P2 mismatch remains. The source uses more vertical space than a real phone viewport; scrolling with a sticky account action is the necessary production adaptation.

## Comparison history

- Initial implementation: matched the selected hierarchy and interaction model. No P0/P1/P2 visual fix was required.

## Follow-up polish

- P3: the production navbar header is intentionally more compact than the concept so page content retains more vertical space.

## Full redesign route audit

- Desktop viewport: 1440 x 900 CSS px.
- Mobile viewport: 390 x 844 requested; the browser exposed a 375px document width.
- No horizontal overflow was found on pricing, integrations, all four use-case pages, all nine product pages, status, roadmap, changelog, security, contact, privacy, terms, sign-in, or sign-up.
- Route-specific H1s and layouts rendered across the audited routes. Product pages now lead with their trace, cost, tool, model, failure, report, control, evaluation, or lifecycle instrument.
- Authentication uses mode-specific editorial panels while preserving the forms. Onboarding uses step-specific setup panels while preserving its stateful controls.
- Landing, blog, and public docs were excluded from implementation scope.

## Verification notes

- Focused ESLint passes for every changed source file.
- Repository-wide lint remains blocked by pre-existing errors in orchestration, blog, landing-page, and shared hook files outside this redesign.
- The development server intermittently exceeded the browser navigation timeout while compiling routes; every public route independently returned HTTP 200 and responsive measurements were recorded after warm-up.

final result: passed
