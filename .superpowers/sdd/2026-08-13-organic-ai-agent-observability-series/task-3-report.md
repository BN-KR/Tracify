# Task 3 report — Author and verify ten long-form article modules

## Files

- Added `scripts/content/articles/article-builder.ts`, a Payload Lexical-only article builder using headings, paragraphs, lists, blockquotes, links, and media uploads.
- Added the ten required article modules in `scripts/content/articles/`.
- Updated `scripts/content/verify-organic-series.mjs` to load each module and validate word count, headings, structural sections, hero upload, internal links, and final CTA.

## Verification

- `node --experimental-specifier-resolution=node scripts/content/verify-organic-series.mjs` passes for all ten modules.
- `npx.cmd tsc --noEmit --allowImportingTsExtensions` passes.
- `npx.cmd eslint scripts/content/verify-organic-series.mjs scripts/content/articles --max-warnings=0` passes.
- `git diff --check` passes.

## Commit

`f65533d` — `feat: author organic content series`; contains only Task 3 files.

## Self-review

- All documents are generated exclusively from the enabled Payload Lexical node types.
- Every document has an introduction, Contents list, framework, grounded example, Visual guide, operational checklist, FAQ, hero-media node, two `/blog/` links, a Tracify `/docs/` or `/product/` link, and final CTA.
- No CMS import or publishing operation was performed.

## Concerns

- Node resolves TypeScript extensionless imports only with `--experimental-specifier-resolution=node`; TypeScript passes with `--allowImportingTsExtensions`. This task does not change the repository-wide TypeScript settings.
- Article metadata and media IDs are intentionally supplied by the manifest and future importer, respectively; these modules only return Lexical content.
