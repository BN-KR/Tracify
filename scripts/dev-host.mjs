/**
 * Run one Tracify host locally, mirroring how production is split.
 *
 * Production serves two different applications from this one codebase:
 * www.tracify.tech (marketing) and eu.cloud.tracify.tech (the cloud app).
 * Which one you get is decided by NEXT_PUBLIC_TRACIFY_DEPLOYMENT_KIND, so a
 * single dev server can only ever be one of them — and a `cloud` server
 * redirects all marketing routes away, while a `marketing` server redirects
 * /dashboard to the region selector.
 *
 * This runs them side by side:
 *   npm run dev:marketing   -> http://localhost:3000  (marketing)
 *   npm run dev:cloud       -> http://localhost:4000  (EU cloud app)
 *
 * Next refuses two dev instances sharing a build directory, so the cloud host
 * uses NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-cloud. Values set here take precedence over
 * .env.local, so no env file edits are needed to switch between them.
